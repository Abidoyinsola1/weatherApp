## The Design Principles used are:

- DRY Principle
- KISS Principle
- YAGNI Principle


### DRY Principle:

```
I utilized this principle to make my code more composed and simpler to keep up. And furthermore spare my time at whatever point I need to change something later on.
```

### KISS Principle:

```
I utilized this principle to make it simpler for other software engineers to envision the different parts of the applications, intellectually planning the potential impacts of any change.
```

### YAGNI Principle:

```
I utilized this principle since it abstains from investing energy on features that may not be used and helps me avoid feature creep.
```
